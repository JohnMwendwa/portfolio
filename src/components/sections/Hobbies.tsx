        Hobbies
      </h2>
      <p>
        Whenever I&apos;m not coding, I tend to engage myself in activties that
        build me up. Some of these activities include but not limited to the
        following :
      </p>
      <div className="py-3 space-y-4">
        <p>
          <span className="text-yellow-400 font-bold">Skating : </span>
          To tell you the truth, I love skating. It&apos;s one of those things I
          can hardly let a day pass by without even taking atleast a 5 minutes
          ride around my neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-yellow-400 font-bold">Travelling : </span>
          If you&apos;re not a kenyan, you wouldn&apos;t understand my obsession
          with travelling, especially outside the city. As a nation, we&apos;ve
          been endowed with great sites that are just breath-taking.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-yellow-400 font-bold">Cooking : </span>
          I&apos;m not a great fan of fast foods and I believe they should be
          taken once in a while and so I have learned to cook my dishes and boy
          ooh boy do I love their taste. Well, I know not everyone finds my
          dishes as tasty as I do, but need I remind them the opinion of my
          stomach and only my stomach concerning this matter supersedes all ðŸ˜Ž.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-yellow-400 font-bold">Movies : </span>
          I&apos;m also a big fan of movies and series. As I was growing up, my
          obsession with them always got me into trouble with my school
          teachers, but that&apos;s a story for another day.
        </p>
